## NEAR HACKATHON PROJECT, 2023 - 3RD PLACE WINNER WITH MY TEAM CALLED DTECTEET

This repo contains an API component detector for NEAR Protocol platform developers.

This is a form of security for developer to build safe and scalable apps on NEAR Protocol platform
and to allow NEAR Protocol have sound secured apps on their platforms.
